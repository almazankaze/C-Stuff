/*
 * As the Formula One Grand Prix was approaching, the officials decided to 
 * make the races a little more interesting with a new set of rules. 
 * According to the new set of rules, each driver will be given a vehicle with 
 * different height and the driver with maximum SIGHT would win the race.

 * SIGHT of a driver is defined by X * P, where
 * X = number of drivers he can see in front of him + number of drivers he can see behind him
 * P = position of the driver in a given scenario ( index of the driver array is  indexed )

 * As all the drivers are moving in a straight line, a driver i cannot see beyond another 
 * driver j if height of j >= height of driver i.
 
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5 where n is number of racers
 * 0 <= H[i] <= 10^6 where H[i] is the height of a racer

 * INPUT
 * each integer represents the height of each racer
 * 41214
 * 51241

 * OUTPUT
 * 5
 * 4
